  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I’m Jonathan, founder and CEO of EFL AG-DATA, a market-data and analytics company 
  focused on the feed and livestock industries across China and Southeast Asia. 
  With over 16 years of industry and research experience, I build data systems, 
  insights, and digital tools that help feed-additive companies, integrators, 
  and agribusinesses make faster, more informed decisions.</p>

  <p>I’m passionate about transforming agriculture through reliable data, 
  practical technology, and solutions that actually work for people on the ground. 
  My work combines a deep understanding of livestock markets with a hands-on approach 
  to building platforms and partnerships. I enjoy connecting with people across 
  the industry to share insights, explore ideas, and create impactful solutions 
  together.</p>
